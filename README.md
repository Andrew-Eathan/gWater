still in the works!  
  
incase someone complains about [gmod-module-base](https://github.com/Facepunch/gmod-module-base) not being a submodule (looking at you, Scummius), i have two things to say:  
	1: i don't care lol  
	2: garry doesn't care about it either so don't expect gmod-module-base to be updated for atleast 2-3 years  

USAGE:  
well, you probably shouldn't be using it yet given it's not ready, but if you insist then:  
- download the latest .dll and .lua from the releases area  
- place the dll in `GarrysMod/garrysmod/lua/bin`  
- place the lua script in `GarrysMod/garrysmod/lua/bin`
- do `sv_allowcslua 1` if you haven't already  
- do `lua_openscript_cl gwater.lua`
